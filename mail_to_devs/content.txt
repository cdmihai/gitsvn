Hello,

Happy New Year!

My name is Caius Brindescu and I am a PhD student at University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am working on a project to improve
current version control systems by making them handle changes more
intelligently. First, we try to find if version control systems affect
the way in which developers commit changes.

We would be grateful if you could supply us with a list of open source
repositories that you contributed to. Also, it would of great help if
you could tell us the username you used to commit code in the
particular repository.

I would like to mention that all the data that we collect will be
anonymous. We will release all the enhancements that we create as open 
source plugins.

Thank you for your time,
Caius
